### Background

One of my favorite games to play growing up was Cooking Mama. Inspired by that childhood nostalgia, I decided to make
this simple ~~bootleg version~~ remake of the classic game.

### Building the Project

#### Dependencies:

* [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
* [catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
* [nlohmanjson](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

This project was made using [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/).

### Playing the Game

#### Objective

Play through the various mini-games to create a tasty dish and have it judged by Meemaw! As of right now, there is one
classic recipe to play (potato salad) and two corresponding mini-games.
